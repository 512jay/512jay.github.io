              RE: Becoming The Next &ldquo;Diamond Trump&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p align="left"> Dear Future Millionaire,</p>
            <p align="left"> Financial freedom as defined by the famous  T.Harv Eker &ndash; Is when your passive income exceeds your lifestyle expenditure.</p>
            <p align="left"> Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; The only way you can be  totally financially free is by building multiple sources of passive income,  whether through businesses or prudent investing.</p>
            <p align="left"> Robert Kiyosaki in his book &lsquo;Rich Dad, Poor  Dad&rsquo; says that the financially free people are the investors, not the managers  or the business owners.</p>
            <p align="left"> Here&rsquo;s the cold, hard fact:</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>The  main reason why 99% of the world is not financially is because they lack the  financial intelligence to make the right financial decisions in life!</strong></p>
            <p align="left"> Ask yourself, have you ever faced any of  these problems in your life?</p>

        <p align="left"> -Feeling helpless and unable to act when it  comes to the area of finance?<br>
                -Feel like you are fighting an uphill battle  trying to escape the rat race, but can&rsquo;t leave your job because you would be  too helpless?<br>
                -Other people seem to deal with the area of  finance with no problems at all.<br>
        -You are totally clueless when it comes to investing.</p>

            <p align="left"> Well, you are not alone. I&rsquo;ve once walked  down this lost path and I told myself that I would do whatever it takes to  figure out the key to mastering all aspects of finance and investments.</p>
            <p align="left"> And after years of research, I&rsquo;ve finally  come up with the ultimate solution.</p>
