    <title>How to Design Programs</title>
    
</head>
<body>
    <p>I strive to always remain a novice by discovering new universes to learn. -Jay Davis 20181111</p>
    <p>It is my goal to fully understand how to design programs, systematically using the methods put forth at <a href="http://htdp.org">htdp.org</a> with multiple computer languages.</p>
    
    <blockquote cite="https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_preface.html"><q>The typical course on programming teaches a “tinker until it works” approach. When it works, students exclaim “It works!” and move on. Sadly, this phrase is also the shortest lie in computing, and it has cost many people many hours of their lives.</q> (Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, & Krrishnamurthi, 2018)<sup> <a href="#footnote1" id="reference1">1</a></sup></blockquote>

    <p>It is my peference to use VSCode as the default programming environment.</p>

    <div class="JavaScript">
        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p>JavaScript has a built in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/assert">console.assert</a> method that can be used to perform simple using tests. It is best to use FireFox when developing as it has support for template strings</p>

    <div class="python">
        <h4>Python</h4>
        <p>Add Python as a language using VSCode's built-in extensions market. Python has built-in support for unit test using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/unit-testing">unittest</a> libary that comes with the basic language.</p>

        <h4>Swift</h4>
        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> is the environment to use when developing with Swift. XCodes come with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest">xctest</a> which has a bit of a learning curve.</p>
